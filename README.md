# fraud-detection-in-electricity-and-gas-consumption

Incomplete fraud detection project using Python.

dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/fraud-detection-in-electricity-and-gas-consumption/data

EDA has been done extensively for the different features in attempt to create new meaningful features to improve model performance.
Model performance (LightGBM) is still poor despite attempts made to create more features.
I highly suspect that it could be due to the quality of the dataset that is causing poor model performance.
